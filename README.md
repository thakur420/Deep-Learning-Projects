# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains deep learning projects implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy.  

## Project: Neural Network from Scratch

In this notebook, `Neural_Net_from_Scratch.ipynb`, we implement a fully connected neural network **from scratch** without using any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  

### Features

- Implementation of forward and backward propagation
- Supports multiple layers
- Uses activation functions like Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh
- Implements binary cross-entropy loss
- Training with gradient descent
- Custom evaluation metrics

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy jupyter
